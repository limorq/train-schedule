# train-schedule

This is a simple online train schedule that will allow administrators to input train info to add a train to the schedule or input a train name to remove from the schedule. 

The online schedule is a timetable that tells users the train name, how often that trains runs in minutes, when the next train arrives, and finally the minutes to arrival.

All train information is stored in Firebase for accurate results.

The purpose of this exercise was to display my ability to work with Firebase, understand how to insert, update, and remove information using an API and render it in realtime on the viewport for user/admin interaction.
